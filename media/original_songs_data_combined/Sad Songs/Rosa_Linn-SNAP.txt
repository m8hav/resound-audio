It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June twenty-second
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out

So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah

And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap

Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart

'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)
'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)
Get out of my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, heart (Oh-woah)
'Cause I might snap (Oh-woah)
Get out of my heart, yeah
'Cause I might snap
