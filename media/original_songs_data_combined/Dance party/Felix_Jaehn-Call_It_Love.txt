Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

Two hearts in a billion, want to fall into you
Make me wanna shout it out like a hallelujah
'Cause time like these, times like these don't come and go
We're two hearts in a billion singing hallelujah

Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Way up in the blaze of gold
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Say, I feel it in the sky above
And way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

Why don't we call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

No sleep, running on a dream down the golden coastline
You give me all I need, I'm like oh my, oh my
'Cause time like these, times like these don't come and go
No sleep, running on a dream, I'm like oh my, oh my

Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Way up in the blaze of gold
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Say, I feel it in the sky above
And way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

Why don't we call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
