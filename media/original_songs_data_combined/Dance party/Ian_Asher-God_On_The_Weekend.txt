When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime

[Verse 1]
Couldn't help it, felt like velvet
Psychedelic, sex angelic
That's how I li-li-like it
When we colli-li-lided
We keep it open-minded, excited
[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' into you
Always somewhere in-between
Don't wanna step off this dream
Fallin' into you
Feelin' like I've seen these signs
Like somewhere in a past life

[Chorus]
Wh–µn was the last time, did somethin' for th–µ first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
Don't need a reason to dive in my deep end
Somethin' to believe in, found God on the weekend
When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
Don't need a reason to dive in my deep end
Somethin' to believe in, found God on the weekend

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Found God on the weekend
Ooh, ooh
Found God on the weekend

[Verse 2]
Tunnel vision, slow collision
Touch me, listen, close the distance
That's how I li-li-like it
Spark it and li-li-light it
We keep it open-minded, excited

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' into you
Always somewhere in-between
Don't wanna step off this dream
Fallin' into you
Feelin' like I've seen these signs
Like somewhere in a past life

[Chorus]
When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
Don't need a reason to dive in my deep end
Somethin' to believe in, found God on the weekend
When was the last time, did somethin' for the first time?
'Cause I need a good night to last for a lifetime
Don't need a reason to dive in my deep end
Somethin' to believe in, found God on the weekend
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Found God on the weekend
Ooh, ooh
Found God on the weekend
