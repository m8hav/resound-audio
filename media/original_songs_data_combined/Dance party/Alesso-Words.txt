I got the words
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
at your house again
are we more than friends
there’s so much that I wanna say
but I gotta hold it back
so scared how you’ll react
I just hide it all away

i could give you it all
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round
i don’t wanna mention commitment but I
feel it slippin so please
don’t let me down
me down

I got the words
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue

oh I feel like
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

you know we connect
more than just the sex
but are you gonna let me in

I could set your world on fire
but you’re holding the lighter
instead you’re putting out our flame

I could give you it all
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round
I don’t wanna mention commitment but I
feel it slippin so please
don’t let me down

I got the words
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue

oh I feel like
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

run away
run away

I got the words
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue

oh I feel like
as soon as they leave my mouth
you’re just gonna get up and run
you’re gonna run away

if I say it now
then one day i’ll wake up and you’ve walked out

so i’ll just stay here with
the words I love you
sitting on the tip of my tongue
