East side coming west side
For a good time
Welcome to the after party
No sleep, run it back, repeat
Drinks all night
Staying up sipping Bacardi

And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party

East side coming west side
For a good time
Welcome to the after party
No sleep, run it back, repeat
Drinks all night
Staying up sipping Bacardi

And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party

East side coming west side
For a good time
Welcome to the after party
No sleep, run it back, repeat
Drinks all night
Staying up sipping Bacardi

And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party

East side coming west side
For a good time
Welcome to the after party
No sleep, run it back, repeat
Drinks all night
Staying up sipping Bacardi

And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party

One time welcome to the after party
And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party

(After party, after party, after party, after party, after party...)

One time welcome to the after party
One time welcome to the after party

East side coming west side
For a good time
Welcome to the after party
No sleep, run it back, repeat
Drinks all night
Staying up sipping Bacardi

And we'll do this again
We'll do this again

Put your hands in the air
One time welcome to the after party
