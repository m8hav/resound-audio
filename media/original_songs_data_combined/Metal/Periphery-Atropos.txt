Don't look down below
We'd rather stay (we'd rather stay)
In a moment and pacified than see
That's how we do it
Don't say its nothing more than a love like that
Gotta chase somebody, yeah, isn't it funny
How much better we seem to get along
When we're face-down in a place where we belong? (Where do we belong?)
Where do we belong?
Pieces, falling pieces, falling pieces I can feel them
Every time I close my eyes, I can feel them in my brain
Pieces, falling pieces, falling pieces I can feel them
Every time I close my eyes, I can feel them fucking my mind
There doesn't have to be a reason
What's the point of taking bits and pieces
Away, away oh from, my high?
You can blame it on the seasons or a lack of serotonin, constant needing
Don't look down below
We'd rather stay (we'd rather stay)
In a moment and pacified than than bleed for eternity
Don't say its nothing more than a love like that
Chase that fucking money, yeah, isn't it funny
How much better we seem to get off
When we're locked in a with a superficial hole? (Where do we belong?)
Where do we belong?
Now everybody sings the same old sad song
Where have we gone wrong?
There's broken bodies in the distance
Right now broken brains are amidst us
Forever? Where do we belong?
Where have we gone wrong?
A lack of body, just caught in the middle
Some say fuck it when they're stuck in the middle
Some say fuck it when they're bleeding a little bit
And can't find the rhythm to get out of it
Get me fucking out of this mess
A lack of anybody, just caught in the middle
The soul is sold
Some they pay, some they want it
We're caught in the middle
But the soul is so empty
Paid in full
Tear the hole, tear the hole inside your soul (inside your soul)
There's broken bodies in the distance
But right now broken brains are amidst us
And you should all just surrender
A lack of body, just caught in the middle
A lack of body, just caught in the middle
Some say fuck it when they're bleeding a little bit
Paid in full
Tear the hole, tear the hole inside your soul
Feel it, feel it, feel it fucking my mind up
Paid in full
Tear the hole, tear the hole inside your soul
Tear it, tear it, tear it in your soul
