Yeah, I got voices in my head again, tread carefully
And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily
I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently
Trauma that I'm burying, I think I need some therapy
I battle depression, I'm back with a message
I'm asking the question that if you hate me, why you acting obsessive?
I'm past the point of no return, fuck being passive aggressive
I'll brandish a weapon, teach all you motherfuckers a lesson
I actually battle my demons and shadows
They swim in the deep and they creep in the shallows, I'm lost
I gotta admit that I'm living the life that I've always wanted
But it comes at a cost
They're licking their chops, they're fixing to rip me apart
I'm swimming with sharks
I'm lifting the bar, I'm lifting it into the stars
I'm like a shot of adrenaline mixed with some Ritalin
You started a battle, but bitch, I'mma finish it
You think you can stop me? Not even a little bit
Nowadays everybody's so sensitive
Taking my words and you pick it apart
Tripping on nothing, just get in the car
Gripping and ripping, I'm sticking the mark
I'm tipping the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-charts
'Cause I got enemies trying to get rid of me
Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally
I got people that don't like me in the industry
I can feel your energy, you are not a friend to me
'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go, yeah
I got dirt on people, but they act like I don't know, yeah
I could do some damage, but I'll never rock the boat
All it takes is one post, watch 'em fall like dominoes
You'll never get rid of me, too many mini-mes ripping my imagery
You know my history, it ain't a mystery
I put every enemy outta they misery
Somebody, send me some positive energy
About to go Darth, about to go Disney
Into the darkness, into infinity and
Shut you motherfuckers up, you listening?
Stacking every little pretty penny that I'm getting
And I'm never giving in to anybody always winning
Never kidding when I die, I'm taking everybody with me
You're never gonna get me 'cause you'll never see it simply
I'm a motherfucking god, you're a light yawn, I'm a time bomb
And the vibes wrong, is this mic on?
I'm killing the syllables with a loaded refillable
I'm a lyrical, typical supervillain, I'm venomous
And I'm never gonna stop until they put me on top of the list
I can't control the monster any longer that's inside
The pain and sorrow left us hollow
No tomorrows hard to swallow
Death is calling so appalling
Tightrope walking, now I'm falling down
Like missiles falling from the sky
Come and save us
The pain and sorrow left us hollow
Here today, but gone tomorrow
The pain inside is the fuel that drives
This flesh and bone through blood red skies
The death defying, hypnotizing
One day you're gonna figure out that
Everything they taught you was a LIE
Watch the world burn
Ah
Ooh
The fear is what keeps you alive
Break the fucking chains, take back your life
The fear is what keeps you insane
Break the fucking chains, take away the pain
