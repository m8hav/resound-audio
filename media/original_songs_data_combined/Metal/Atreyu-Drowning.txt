Watching the walls in my head growing higher
Weight of my thoughts got me too tired to climb
I'm screaming for help as I suffer in silence
Knife at my neck, yeah I'm numb to the violence
'Cause I'm drowning
Head underwater, I'm alone
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow (caught in the undertow)
Go!
The crowds in my head always blocked out the sun
I keep having nightmares of not waking up
Will I stay in here for a lifetime?
(Will I stay in here for a lifetime?)
Who is the one to get stuck in my head?
If I'm drowning
Head underwater, I'm alone
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow
And it feels like I'm trying to find something
That was never even there
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow (caught in the undertow)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
I'm drowning
Head underwater, I'm alone
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow
And it feels like I'm trying to find something
That was never even there
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow
Caught in the undertow
I'm drowning in the undertow
