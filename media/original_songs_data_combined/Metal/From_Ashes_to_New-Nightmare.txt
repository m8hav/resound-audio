I let you in
You sunk your knife so deep under my skin
And cut my heart from me
Where did you go?
Where's the person you used to be?
I don't know you, and you don't know me
You're all alone, and you only refuse to see
Let me show you what you can't show me
I will erase the nightmare you became
It comes in waves, you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare you became
Nightmare
You're in my head
Buried so deep inside
You want me dead
But I feel so alive
Look at you now that there's nowhere for you to run
I cut you out, and the pain is gone
I had my doubts
When it started to come undone
You fucked around, and you broke my trust
I will erase the nightmare you became
It comes in waves, you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare you became
Nightmare
Now I lay me down to sleep
You're the devil in my dreams
Swear to God, I will erase
This nightmare you became
Now I lay me down to sleep
You're the devil in my dreams
Swear to God, I will erase
This nightmare that you became
Fuck
I will erase the nightmare you became
It comes in waves, you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare you became
Nightmare
