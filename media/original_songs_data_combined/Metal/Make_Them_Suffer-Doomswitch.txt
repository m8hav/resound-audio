They're long winters in the city of spirals
Toxic cycle, toxic cycle
With neon hinterlands, you cynically eye-roll
Toxic cycle, suicidal
(But there's a weight upon your chest)
Deserted homes, but you know
Turn yourself 'round or you'll be lost in death
Usurpers, drones, but you know
Turn yourself 'round or you'll be just like them
(So you can be someone they can't)
So you can face yourself, face the world
Even through it all
(This city's back to haunt you)
(This city's out to get you)
Face yourself, face this curse
(Doomswitch)
They're all fictional, incipient idols
Unwanted (prayers), forgotten (beds)
They're long winters in the city of spirals
Accursed (hexed), despondent (dead)
Cursed, your words
You're cursed
Deserted homes, but you know
Turn yourself 'round or you'll be lost in death
Usurpers, drones, but you know
Turn yourself 'round or you'll be just like
So you can face yourself, face the world
Even through it all
(This city's back to haunt you)
(This city's out to get you)
Face yourself, face this curse
(Doomswitch)
Deserted
This city's back to haunt you
Usurper
Buried down into your core
You know this story, you know how it ends
But you don't know the world around you sees you just like them
Just like them
