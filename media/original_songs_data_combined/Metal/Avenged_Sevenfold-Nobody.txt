Ride in the shadows, wondering beyond the frame
Lone like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Here we're with the dignity and the dance we've shared before
Somewhat this illusion this is how you pull as I endure
Here we plug so high, no high, no coming down
Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I'm the sun
I'm the sun, yeah
I'm the God
I'm the wake
I'm the one in everything
I'm the life
I'm the death
I'm a man without a head
I walk with death in final exhalation
(I'm the wake) and come apart through violent separation
(I'm the one in everything) a thousand floors ascend into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm the life) and down below I leave a stranger laying
(I'm the death) lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
(I'm a man without a head) I ascend and leave behind the "used to be"
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes (and see)
(I see, I see) nobody
Breath in the silence
Every flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum
In like a dark an equal face
All I ever was, has been and always will be
Here I am as I'm starting again
Beyond death and born on the wind
I'm the sun
I'm the sun, yeah
I'm the God
I'm the wake
I'm the one in everything
I'm the life
I'm the death
I'm a man without a head
A crack in the darkness
Such air in the sky
(I'm the one in everything) and there the moment when we find ourselves
And all we occupy
Return to the fondness
Immersing the freed
Letting go as you lose your name
And all you've known to be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
