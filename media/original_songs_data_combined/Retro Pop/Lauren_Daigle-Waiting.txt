"The right one's gonna come along someday"
"You're probably just getting in your own way"
These are the things people try to say
When they don't want you to wait

When you wait, you're always countin'
Self-assured but somehow doubtin'
Wonderin' what you got yourself into
Toss and turn, anticipatin'
All the while, your heart is achin'
Knowin' that the day is comin' soon 

That's what it feels like waitin' for You
That's what it feels like waitin' for You

I'm givin' up all the cares that I could give
I'm throwin' caution to the wind
Just to find out if I let it go
Will love every time

When you wait, you're always countin'
Self-assured but somehow doubtin'
Wonderin' what you got yourself into
Toss and turn, anticipatin'
All the while, your heart is achin'
Knowin' that the day is comin' soon

That's what it feels like waitin' for You
That's what it feels like waitin' for You

Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You (Oh, I'm here, I'm ready)
Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun (Oh, waitin' on You; I'm waitin' on You)
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You (Ooh oh-oh-oh-oh)
Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun (Ooh-hoo)
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You (Oh, I'm here, I'm ready)
Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun (Oh, waitin' on)
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You (Oh, this is my love, this is my love)
Waitin' on, on a love like the sky waits for the sun (Oh, waitin' on for You)
I'm the one who'll be waiting (I'm the one)
I'm the one who'll be waitin' for You
