I never saw you like that
Never thought that I would catch your eye
So when feelings came I turned my back woah
I'm not the starting-drama type
I'm well aware of the friends we share
And I don't wanna cross that line
Then all of a sudden we're kissing at parties
Getting real drunk and then dancing real naughty
There's an elephant in this room
Let's not beat around the bush boy you want me
Eyes tracing me from my lips to my body
You can tell that I want you too
And it's uh uh so good
So what's a girl to do?
Are we gonna ignore that it was good?
Are we gonna pretend
Like I can't love you better
Than she ever could?
Are we gonna ignore the times
I've watched you get lost in my eyes
Let me love you better baby
Than she ever could
Ain't that the point of being young?
My heart will break, I'll make mistakes
I'll do shit I wish I hadn't done woah
I been weighing pros and cons
But this chemistry is tempting me
And I don't feel like moving on
Then all of a sudden you're buying my coffee
Knees touching under the table so softly
There's an elephant in this room
Let's not beat around the bush boy you want me
Eyes tracing me from my lips to my body
You can tell that I want you too
And it's it uh uh so good
So what's a girl to do?
Are we gonna ignore that it was good?
Are we gonna pretend like I can't love you better
Than she ever could?
Are we gonna ignore the times
I've watched you get lost in my eyes
Let me love you better baby
Than she ever could
Come inside
Close your eyes
If there was no such thing as consequences
Then would you be mine?
Up the stairs
Nobody but us there
Is there such thing as the right time
Are we gonna ignore that it was good?
Are we gonna pretend
Like I can't love you better
Than she ever could?
Are we gonna ignore the signs?
Cause we've moved past just being kind
Let me love you better
Than she
Are we gonna ignore that it was good?
Are we gonna pretend
Like I can't love you better
Than she ever could?
Are we gonna ignore the times
I've watched you get lost in my eyes
Let me love you better, baby
Than she ever could
Are we gonna ignore that it was good?
Are we gonna pretend
Like I can't love you better
Than she ever could?
Are we gonna ignore the times
I've watched you get lost in my eyes
Let me love you better, baby
Than she ever could
