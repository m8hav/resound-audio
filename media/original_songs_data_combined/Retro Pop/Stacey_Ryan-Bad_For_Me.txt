I know you’re so bad for me, baby
There’s no way I don’t know that, baby
I know you’re so bad for me, baby
There’s no way you don’t drive me crazy

You’re Midas, you know it, you touch me, it’s golden
I feel it when you’re holding me the way that you do
I look for the good in you, I know I shouldn’t
But I’d rather be blind instead of seeing the truth

I know, I know, I know you’re no good for me
And it will end eventually if we keep going down this road
You know, you know, you know you’re affecting me mentally
And I can’t sleep, I count sheep but that shit’s useless ’cause

The voice in my head keeps on saying that you’re bad for me
But the boy in my bed is thе only thing I can see
You make me uneasy, you’rе toxic and unhealthy but
It’s too bad that it’s too good, I know that you’re bad

Can you convince me that you’ll never leave me?
You assure me but they’re just words that I don’t believe
You know, you know, you know you’re affecting me mentally
And I can’t sleep, I count sheep but that shit’s useless ’cause

The voice in my head keeps on saying that you’re bad for me
But the boy in my bed is the only thing I can see
You make me uneasy, you’re toxic and unhealthy but
It’s too bad that it’s too good, I know that you’re bad
The voice in my head keeps on saying that you’re bad for me
But the boy in my bed is the only thing I can see
You make me uneasy, you’re toxic and unhealthy but
It’s too bad that it’s too good, I know that you’re bad for me

I know you’re so bad for me, baby (You’re so bad)
There’s no way I don’t know that, baby (I know that you’re bad for me)
I know you’re so bad for me, baby (You’re so bad for me)
There’s no way you don’t drive me crazy
