This song if for you
I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars, get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it's with you
And I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you
And I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horse and carriage
You know I'm savage, you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting love
But only if it's with you
Let's crash a wedding tonight, get drunk by the lights
Then, I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you
And I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots
Dance in the wind just to do it again, yeah, it's true
But only if it's with you
Yeah, I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horse and carriage
You know I'm savage, but you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting
I'm kinda crazy, 'cause that's how you make me
I don't need Jesus, oh baby, you saved me, I'm done
But only if it's with you
You (you, only with you, whoa-oh)
(You, only with you, whoa-oh)
(You, only with you, whoa-oh)
You, oh you, only with you
Thank you
So cute, you too are so fucking cute
