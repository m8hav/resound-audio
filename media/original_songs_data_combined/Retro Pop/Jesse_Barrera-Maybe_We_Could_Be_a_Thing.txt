No I'm not usually sentimental
I'm quite the opposite
But you take me to a level so high
Because my tummy's feeling funny
Is this the butterflies?
I'm going kinda crazy inside
I wanna believe that it's real
(Tell me this is real)
That someone like you makes me feel how I feel
I can't tell you baby what it was
I think I like you just because
(Just because)
The way things been going lately
It probably won't
But it could be amazing
Maybe we could be a thing
Maybe we should be a thing
It's not a smile that I've been wearing
I'm just an ordinary guy who thinks that life is scary sometimes
But I know it's more than just whatever
Al said "let's stay together"
It's now or never, baby it's time
Ooo
I'm thinking maybe it's something that's real
(Tell me that it's real)
That would explain why I feel how I feel
I can't tell you baby what it was
I think I like you just because
(Just because)
The way things been going lately
It probably won't
But it could be amazing
Maybe we could be a thing
LALALA LA LA
Maybe we should be a thing
Cause I like you just because
LALALA LA LA
