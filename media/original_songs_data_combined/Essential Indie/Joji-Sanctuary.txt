Go ahead and bark after dark, fallen star
I'm your one-call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want, sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I'll give you something so real

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Hold me oh so close, 'cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

If you've been waiting for falling in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
