Wajda woofer
Aan boohey vich
Wajda woofer gaddi ‘ch

It still ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang
‘G’ thang!
‘G’ thang!
I jumped out of the car, let the beat bang

Wajda woofer gaddi ch
Pehndi dhamak gali vich saari
Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
Teri mittran de naal

Mumbaiii, Lets Go…
(Wajda woofer gaddi ‘ch)
Zeus
You got what I want
What I want is what you got

Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
What…
Big up as we have snoop dogg in the house yea

Wajda woofer gaddi ‘ch
Pehndi dhamak gali vich saari
(Say what?)

Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
Bro! Bro!
I told you moth****s that I just can’t stop
O o o…
I jumped out the car let the beat bang
It still ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang
With that heat man, I stand tall
Homie out of pocket get yo man dawg

Your girl in love with a crip cuz
I seen her on the pole at a strip club
Scoopin up money in a trash bag
Long weave, asṣ fat
All on a n*gga tip
Drip drop, drop drip
Look at these hoes all over a pimp
My system thump, woofers knock
Hustlin for the money like I’m working the block
I told you moth***s that I just can’t stop
You punch the clock
See I just aim and pop and set up shop
Until I make the beat go pop

Wajda woofer gaddi ‘ch
Pehndi dhamak gali vich saari
Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
Teri mittran de naal yaari

You got what I want
What I want is what you got
You know what to do
Coz you drop it like its hot
Everybody knows it’s Zeus in the spot
Repping east n west
Wooferrr!

Smoking on my vapour
Piling up my paper
Thtas right
Smoking on that vapour
Stacking up that paper..

It still ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang

Gali teri aa ke dil ho jaye baago baag ni
Chakki jaye speaker-aan di sohniye
Jaggi Jagowal kurrey
Patteya teri dildari
Woofer gaddi ‘ch
Pehndi dhamak gali vich saari
Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
Teri mittran de naal yaari

What?

Woofer gaddi ‘ch
You got what I want
What I want is what you got
Aan boohey vich khad jaavey
Lets go!
You know what to do
Coz you drop it like its hot

Woofer…
Woo woo woo…
