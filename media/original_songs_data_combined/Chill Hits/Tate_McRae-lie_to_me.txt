You don't understand
I'm not ever like this
I can hold my breath
Say I'll be alright
But kinda hard to think
When I can't feel a thing
Tell me to my face
Already heard it last week
Driving me insane
It's hitting real badly
Tell me what's her name, yeah

Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me, yeah
Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me, yeah
(Lie to me)

After everything we've been through you come crying to me
You said you'd never lie, so why you lying to me?
I gave you my trust my heart and everything inside of me
Tell me how'd you pay me back? You made a fool out of me

Can't you see what you're doing? Left me, broken in pieces
Got me feeling so stupid, guess I needed a reason
To let go
I don't wanna hear lies anymore

Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
(Lie to me)
Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me

I've been tryna collect all my thoughts
It's all said and done
Just don't feel the same
(Don't feel the same)
Don't try to tell me that I was wrong
You was the one lying all along
I think you just want somebody else to take the blame

Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me, yeah
(Lie to me, yeah)
Said you'd never, why'd you ever
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me
Lie to me baby, lie, lie to me, yeah
Why you gotta lie to me
