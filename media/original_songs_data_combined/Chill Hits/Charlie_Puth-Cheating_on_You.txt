It started with a kiss on your momma's couch
2012 was nothin' serious
And then we caught the feels, it got really real
Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky, shouldn't have did you wrong
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away
Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

I said goodbye
And you said goodbye
