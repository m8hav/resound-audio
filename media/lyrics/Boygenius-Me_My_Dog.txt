We had a great day<br>Even though we forgot to eat<br>And you had a bad dream<br>And we got no sleep<br>'Cause we were kissing<br><br>I had a fever<br>Until I met you<br>Now you make me cool<br>But sometimes I still do<br>Something embarrassing<br><br>I never said I'd be all right<br>Just thought I could hold myself together<br>When I couldn't breathe, I went outside<br>Don't know why I thought it'd be any better<br>I'm fine now, it doesn't matter<br><br>I didn't wanna be this guy<br>I cried at your show with the teenagers<br>Tell your friend I'll be all right<br>In the morning it won't matter<br><br>I wanna be emaciated<br>I wanna hear one song without thinking of you<br>I wish I was on a spaceship<br>Just me and my dog and an impossible view<br><br>I dream about it<br>And I wake up falling
