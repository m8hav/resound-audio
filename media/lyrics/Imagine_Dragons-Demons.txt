When the days are cold<br>And the cards all fold<br>And the saints we see are all made of gold<br>When your dreams all fail<br>And the ones we hail<br>Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale<br>I wanna hide the truth<br>I wanna shelter you<br>But with the beast inside<br>There's nowhere we can hide<br>No matter what we breed<br>We still are made of greed<br>This is my kingdom come<br>This is my kingdom come<br>When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide<br>Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide<br>At the curtain's call<br>It's the last of all<br>When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl<br>So they dug your grave<br>And the masquerade<br>Will come calling out at the mess you've made<br>Don't wanna let you down<br>But I am hell-bound<br>Though this is all for you<br>Don't wanna hide the truth<br>No matter what we breed<br>We still are made of greed<br>This is my kingdom come<br>This is my kingdom come<br>When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide<br>Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide<br>They say it's what you make<br>I say it's up to fate<br>It's woven in my soul<br>I need to let you go<br>Your eyes, they shine so bright<br>I wanna save that light<br>I can't escape this now<br>Unless you show me how<br>When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide<br>Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>It's where my demons hide<br>It's where my demons hide
