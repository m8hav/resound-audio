At last<br>My love has come along<br>My lonely days are over<br>And life is like a song<br><br>Oh yeah yeah<br>At last<br><br>The skies above are blue<br>My heart was wrapped up in clover<br>The night I looked at you<br><br>I found a dream, that I could speak to<br>A dream that I can call my own<br>I found a thrill to press my cheek to<br>A thrill that I have never known<br><br>Oh yeah yeah<br>You smiled, you smiled<br>Oh and then the spell was cast<br>And here we are in heaven<br>For you are mine...<br><br>At Last
