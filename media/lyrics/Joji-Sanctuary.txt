Go ahead and bark after dark, fallen star<br>I'm your one-call away<br>Motel halls, neon walls<br>When night falls I am your escape<br>When you lay alone, I ache<br>Something I wanted to feel<br><br>If you've been waiting for falling in love<br>Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above<br>But an angel ain't what I need<br><br>Not anyone, you're the one<br>More than fun, you're the sanctuary<br>'Cause what you want is what I want, sincerity<br><br>Souls that dream alone lie awake<br>I'll give you something so real<br><br>If you've been waiting for falling in love<br>Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above<br>But an angel ain't what I need<br><br>Hold me oh so close, 'cause you never know<br>Just how long our lives will be<br><br>If you've been waiting for falling in love<br>Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above<br>But an angel ain't what I need
