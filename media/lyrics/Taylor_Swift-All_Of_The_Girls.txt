When you think of all the late nights<br>Lame fights over the phone<br>Wake up in the mornin' with someone<br>But feeling alone<br> <br>A heart is drawn 'round your name<br>In someone's handwriting, not mine<br>We’re sneakin' out into town<br>Holdin' hands, just killing time<br> <br>Your past and mine are parallel lines<br>Stars all aligned, they intertwined<br>And taught you, the way you call me "baby"<br>Treat me like a lady,<br>All that I can say is<br> <br>All of the girls you've loved before (Ooh)<br>Made you the one I've fallen for<br>Every dead-end street led you straight to me<br>Now, you're all I need, I'm so thankful for<br>All of the girls you've loved before<br>But I love you more<br> <br>When I think of all the makeup<br>Fake love out on the town (Ooh)<br>Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude<br>Whose name I cannot remember now<br> <br>Secret jokes all alone<br>No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)<br>We're breakin' up, makin' up<br>Leave without saying goodbye (Ooh)<br> <br>And Just know that it's everything that made me<br>Now, I call you "baby," that's why you're so amazing<br> <br>All of the girls you've loved before (Ooh)<br>Made you the one I've fallen for<br>Every dead-end street led you straight to me<br>Now, you're all I need, I'm so thankful for<br>All of the girls you've loved before<br>And I love you more<br> <br>Your mother brought you up loyal and kind<br>Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye<br>Every woman that you knew brought you here<br>I wanna teach you how forever feels like<br> <br>The girls you've loved before (Ooh)<br>Made you the one I've fallen for<br>Every dead-end street (Every dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)<br>Now, you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for<br>All of the girls you've loved before<br>I love you more<br>https://lyricstranslate.com
