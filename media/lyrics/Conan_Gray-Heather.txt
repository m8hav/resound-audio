I still remember the third of December, me in your sweater<br>You said it looked better on me than it did you<br>Only if you knew how much I liked you<br>But I watch your eyes as she<br>Walks by<br>What a sight for sore eyes<br>Brighter than the blue sky<br>She's got you mesmerized while I die<br>Why would you ever kiss me?<br>I'm not even half as pretty<br>You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br>But you like her better<br>Wish I were Heather<br>Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand<br>Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder<br>But how could I hate her? She's such an angel<br>But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she<br>Walks by<br>What a sight for sore eyes<br>Brighter than the blue sky<br>She's got you mesmerized while I die<br>Why would you ever kiss me?<br>I'm not even half as pretty<br>You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br>But you like her better<br>I wish I were Heather<br>I wish I were Heather<br>(Oh, oh)<br>Wish I were Heather<br>Why would you ever kiss me?<br>I'm not even half as pretty<br>You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br>But you like her better<br>Wish I were
