I was walking in the park dreaming of a spark<br>When I heard the sprinklers whisper<br>Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns<br>Then I heard the children singing<br>They were running through the rainbows<br>They were singing a song for you<br>Well it seemed to be a song for you<br>The one I wanted to write for you, for you<br>Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green<br>When I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen<br>A penny for your thoughts my dear<br>A penny for your thoughts my dear<br>I.O.U. for your love, IOU for your love<br><br>Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue<br>When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you<br>A penny for your thoughts my dear<br>A penny for your thoughts my dear<br>IOU for your love, IOU for your love<br><br>For your love
