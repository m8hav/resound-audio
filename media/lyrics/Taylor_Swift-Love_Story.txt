We were both young when I first saw you<br>I close my eyes and the flashback starts:<br>I'm standing there<br>On a balcony in summer air<br><br>See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>See you make your way through the crowd<br>And say, "Hello."<br>Little did I know<br><br>That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."<br>And I was crying on the staircase<br>Begging you, "Please don't go."<br>And I said<br><br>"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run<br>You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br><br>So, I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>So, close your eyes<br>Escape this town for a little while<br>Oh, oh<br><br>'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter<br>And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."<br>But you were everything to me<br>I was begging you, "Please don't go!"<br>And I said<br><br>"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run<br>You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'<br><br>Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel<br>This love is difficult but it's real<br>Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br><br>Oh, oh, oh<br><br>I got tired of waiting<br>Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>My faith in you was fading<br>When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>And I said<br><br>"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone<br>I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."<br>He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said<br><br>"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone<br>I love you, and that's all I really know<br>I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br><br>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br><br>'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
