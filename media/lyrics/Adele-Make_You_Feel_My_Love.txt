When the rain is blowing in your face<br>And the whole world is on your case<br>I could offer you a warm embrace<br>To make you feel my love<br><br>When the evening shadows and the stars appear<br>And there is no one there to dry your tears<br>I could hold you for a million years<br>To make you feel my love<br><br>I know you haven't made your mind up yet<br>But I will never do you wrong<br>I've known it from the moment that we met<br>No doubt in my mind where you belong<br><br>I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue<br>I'd go crawling down the avenue<br>No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do<br>To make you feel my love<br><br>The storms are raging on the rolling sea<br>And on the highway of regret<br>The winds of change are blowing wild and free<br>You ain't seen nothing like me yet<br><br>I could make you happy, make your dreams come true<br>Nothing that I wouldn't do<br>Go to the ends of the Earth for you<br>To make you feel my love<br>To make you feel my love
