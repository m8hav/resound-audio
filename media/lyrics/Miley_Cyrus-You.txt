This song if for you<br>I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards<br>Smoke Cuban cigars, get kicked out of bars before two<br>But only if it's with you<br>And I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes<br>Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon<br>But only if it's with you<br>And I got some baggage, let's do some damage<br>I am not made for no horse and carriage<br>You know I'm savage, you're looking past it<br>I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting love<br>But only if it's with you<br>Let's crash a wedding tonight, get drunk by the lights<br>Then, I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room<br>But only if it's with you<br>And I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots<br>Dance in the wind just to do it again, yeah, it's true<br>But only if it's with you<br>Yeah, I got some baggage, let's do some damage<br>I am not made for no horse and carriage<br>You know I'm savage, but you're looking past it<br>I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting<br>I'm kinda crazy, 'cause that's how you make me<br>I don't need Jesus, oh baby, you saved me, I'm done<br>But only if it's with you<br>You (you, only with you, whoa-oh)<br>(You, only with you, whoa-oh)<br>(You, only with you, whoa-oh)<br>You, oh you, only with you<br>Thank you<br>So cute, you too are so fucking cute
